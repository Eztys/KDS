# KDS

This is an Arduino library for K-line serial communication through the diagnostic port of Kawasaki motorcycles.
The communication protocol with the motorcycle is following the ISO-14230 standard.

Currently only low-level functions (initiate communication, transmit and receive messages) are available. 
But the code is under development and will be regularly updated with new and higher-level features.
